int ledPin = 11;    // LED connected to digital pin 9


// ANALOG DON'T NEED PIN SETUP AS DIGITAL ONE
// THE PINS WHICH IS PWN CAN WORK AS BOTH ANALOG OR SETUP
// UP TO THE CODE YOU WRITE TO IT
void setup()  { 
  // nothing happens in setup 
} 

// ACTUALLY IT'S BLINKING FREAKING FAST~!!!

void loop()  { 
  // fade in from min to max in increments of 5 points:
  for(int fadeValue = 0 ; fadeValue <= 255; fadeValue +=1) { 
    // sets the value (range from 0 to 255):
    analogWrite(ledPin, fadeValue);         
    // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect    
    delay(60);                            
  } 

  // fade out from max to min in increments of 5 points:
  for(int fadeValue = 255 ; fadeValue >= 0; fadeValue -=5) { 
    // sets the value (range from 0 to 255):
    analogWrite(ledPin, fadeValue);         
    // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect    
    delay(60);                            
  }
